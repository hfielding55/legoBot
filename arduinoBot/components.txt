Decent number of wires
1x Breadboard
1x Arduino Uno
1x 10 pin Arduino lcd tft screen
1x Diode 1N4007 (any small diode will do)
3x 6x6mm push switch
3x 20K ohm resistor

For connecting the cables:
There are various ways for splitting the cable and connecting it to the breadboard, you are welcome to use any other method as long as it splits all six wires. I used:
2x 6 pin terminal block
2x lego ev3 cable - cut and stripped into the 6 individual cables.

1x lego ev3 touch sensor
